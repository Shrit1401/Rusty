# Rusty ðŸ¦€ðŸ¤–

**Rusty** is my personal AI assistant CLI built entirely in **Rust**.  
I'm building it as a fun way to challenge myself and learn Rust from the ground up â€” yes, it's known to be a tough language, but that's exactly why I'm here.

### âœ… Features in Progress

- [ ] Chat with AI
- [ ] Book calendar events
- [ ] Voice commands (planned)
- [ ] Command-line interface with intuitive prompts

### ðŸ§© Beginner-Friendly Roadmap (Tiny Steps!)

Hereâ€™s a super small-step breakdown to help me (and others) build Rusty from scratch. Every task is super tiny to keep momentum going and reduce overwhelm.

#### Phase 1: Setup & Basic CLI

- [x] Install Rust & Cargo
- [x] Set up `cargo new rusty`
- [x] Add colorful terminal output using `colored` crate
- [ ] Print a welcome message when the app runs
- [ ] Ask user for input using `stdin`
- [ ] Perform simple math (like adding two numbers)
- [ ] Use `match` for CLI options

#### Phase 2: Structure Code Better

- [ ] Move logic into functions
- [ ] Organize files with modules (`mod`)
- [ ] Learn how to use `Result` and `Option` properly
- [ ] Add basic error handling

#### Phase 3: Add AI (LlamaAI from HackClub)

- [ ] Read HackClubâ€™s LlamaAI docs
- [ ] Set up HTTP request to talk to LlamaAI
- [ ] Create a function to send a prompt and get a response
- [ ] Print AIâ€™s reply in the terminal
- [ ] Wrap it as an option in the CLI menu

#### Phase 4: Expand CLI Power

- [ ] Add command to save notes to a file
- [ ] Add command to schedule a calendar event (mock)
- [ ] Handle multiple CLI commands with a loop

#### Phase 5: Make It Feel Alive

- [ ] Add emojis and formatting for friendly UX
- [ ] Add a typing animation (print char-by-char)
- [ ] Show usage tips or examples

### ðŸš€ Why This Project?

I wanted a hands-on way to pick up Rust â€” and what better way than creating something actually useful? Rusty will eventually become a CLI personal assistant that helps me manage tasks, calendars, and more.

## Current Phase

### ðŸŒž Part of Hack Club's Summer of Making

This project is part of **Hack Clubâ€™s Summer of Making**, a space to build, learn, and create alongside a global community of makers. Rusty is my way of diving deep into Rust while crafting something meaningful and practical.

Let's see how good it gets! :)
