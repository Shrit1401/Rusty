# Rusty ðŸ¦€ðŸ¤–

**Rusty** was a simple CLI built in **Rust** that let me talk with an AI assistant named Rusty.  
I built it as a fun way to challenge myself and learn Rust from the ground up â€” yes, it's known to be a tough language, but that was exactly the point.

To use rusty you can either clone the repository and run `cargo run` or download the rusty file and run it.
