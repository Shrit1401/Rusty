# Rusty ðŸ¦€ðŸ¤–

**Rusty** is my personal AI assistant CLI built entirely in **Rust**.  
I'm building it as a fun way to challenge myself and learn Rust from the ground up â€” yes, it's known to be a tough language, but that's exactly why I'm here.

### ðŸŒ± Learning Phase

Right now, Rusty is in its early learning phase. I'm still exploring the language while gradually building out features. Itâ€™s a work-in-progress but an exciting one!

### âœ… Features in Progress

- [ ] Chat with AI
- [ ] Book calendar events
- [ ] Voice commands (planned)
- [ ] Command-line interface with intuitive prompts

### ðŸš€ Why This Project?

I wanted a hands-on way to pick up Rust â€” and what better way than creating something actually useful? Rusty will eventually become a CLI personal assistant that helps me manage tasks, calendars, and more.

### ðŸŒž Part of Hack Club's Summer of Making

This project is part of **Hack Clubâ€™s Summer of Making**, a space to build, learn, and create alongside a global community of makers. Rusty is my way of diving deep into Rust while crafting something meaningful and practical.

Let's see how good it gets! :)
